# Home NAS with Raspberry Pi 5 and SD Cards

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a home NAS using a Raspberry Pi 5 and SD cards. Utilizing SD cards with lifetime warranties provides a cost-effective and reliable storage solution. This setup leverages ZFS for data integrity, redundancy, and advanced features like compression and snapshots.

## Why Use SD Cards?

- **Cost-Effective**: SD cards are generally cheaper compared to traditional hard drives or SSDs.
- **Lifetime Warranty**: Many high-quality SD cards come with lifetime warranties, ensuring long-term reliability.
- **Energy Efficient**: SD cards consume less power, making them ideal for a low-power device like the Raspberry Pi 5.
- **Compact and Quiet**: SD cards are small and silent, contributing to a clutter-free and noiseless environment.

## Why Use Raspberry Pi 5?

- **Affordable**: Raspberry Pi 5 offers a powerful yet affordable platform for building a home NAS.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Perfect for a 24/7 running NAS system.
- **Flexibility**: The Raspberry Pi 5 supports various software and can be easily customized.
